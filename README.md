This is a example project following by the this example (https://www.learnstorybook.com/intro-to-storybook/react/en/get-started/) but bootstrapped by Typescript.

Here, I used Typescript and configured project for the typescript development with Storybook.

- Used Automated Testing
- Applied Visual TDD
- Using Babel Macros

# Run the test runner (Jest) in a terminal:
yarn test

# Start the component explorer on port 9009:
yarn run storybook

# Run the frontend app proper on port 3000:
yarn start
